# Hotel App

This project is a Mock Hotel Booking Site using NodeJS

## Highlight

This website uses NodeJS and MySQL to allow dynamic changing of availability of rooms in the website, As well as keeps track of every users past bookings as well using a secure login and registration system.

## My personal Takeways
This was my first full-stack application where I learned how to build a user login system using Express.js and Node.js. I added features to lock certain pages so that only logged-in users can access them. I also used bcrypt for the first time to securely encrypt passwords stored in a SQL database.

Working on this project taught me how all the parts of a full-stack application come together and how to make everything work smoothly.

## Future Implementations
Create a Admin Page to ensure that Admins can login using admin credentials and add and remove rooms from the website itself

Make the website responsive

Implement more animations and styling to the page

Fix bug regarding the navbar, Where the fonts are different during certain pages IE: The font in the navbar when navigating through amenities is lighter than when it's in the about us. I want them all to be in that light style
